STL - Standard Template Library 
Library of generic classes and functions 
Why use STL? - To use reusability : Well tested components, saves time.   
Components of STL - (work together with co-ordination)
    - Containers --> stores data 
    - Algorithms --> set of procedures (sorting, searching) 
    - Iterators  --> object points to an element in a container, handled just like pointers 
                     and connects algorithms with containers 
*/                    

/* types of containers 
Sequence containers --> stores data in linear fashion (Vectors, list, Dequeue)
    1) Vector - Random Access faster, Insertion and deletion slower , insertion at end is faster  
    2) List - Random Access slower, insertion in middle fast, Del/ins in end fast

Associative containers --> direct access (Map/Multimap , Set/Multiset) - searching becomes faster and easier with trees 
    - All operation are fast except random Access because it stores element in tree structure 
 
Derived containers --> are derived sequence, asoociative containers and Real world modelling (Stack,Queue,Priority Queue)
    - Depends on the data
